# Course 5 - Quantitative Finance
Quantitative Finance is an elective course from the specialization in Finance at WU Vienna, taught by Prof. Stefan Pichler. In this course we covered pricing models based on the no-arbitrage assumption first in discrete, later in continuous time. We covered mathematically more involved concepts like filtered probability spaces, Wiener processes, Ito’s Lemma, and change-of-numeraire techniques, including a detailed derivation of the Black-Scholes formula. I passed the course with the best possible grade being the best student in the group and among the top 1% of students that ever took this course. 

In this repo, I will store the PDF reports and scripts for the 2 home assignments.
